                    A token is a digital representation of an asset or utility that can be stored, transferred, and verified on a blockchain. Tokens can have different functions, such as representing ownership of a physical asset (like real estate).

                    Investors have the opportunity to earn profits in two main ways. Firstly, through property appreciation, where the project's evolution and real estate market's value increase can raise the value of owned tokens. Secondly, for rental properties, investors can receive periodic rental payments proportional to their token ownership. These two avenues offer potential income sources and the possibility of attractive returns on real estate investments.
